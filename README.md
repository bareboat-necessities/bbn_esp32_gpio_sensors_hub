## Supported Sensors

### PIR Motion Sensor (AS312) to NMEA-0183

PIR Motion Sensor (AS312) connected to M5Stack AtomS3-Lite via GPIO digital pin (see gpio_pir_as312.h code pin number)

White 'IN^' goes to the digital GPIO pin of m5Atom.

Generates NMEA-0183 XDR sentences (USB Serial with baud rate 4800) like this:

````
$BBXDR,S,1,,PIR_MOTION*26
````

M5Stack PIR Motion Sensor (AS312)

Can detect a walrus on your boat or someone else :)


###  Ocean TDS CQRobot (Total Dissolved Solids) Meter Sensor to NMEA-0183

https://www.cqrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1122

M5Stack with AtomS3-Lite and Ocean TDS CQRobot (Total Dissolved Solids) Meter Sensor CQRSENTDS01 to NMEA-0183.

Connected to GPIO pin G7 as analog input.

Generates NMEA-0183 XDR sentences (USB Serial with baud rate 4800) like this:

Total Dissolved Solids in ppt (Parts per Thousand):

````
$BBXDR,X,0.3955,S,TDS*12
$BBXDR,X,0.3958,S,TDS*1F
$BBXDR,X,0.3952,S,TDS*15
$BBXDR,X,0.3955,S,TDS*12
````

ppm = ppt * 1000

The ideal TDS level for drinking water is 300â€“500 ppm, while 500 ppm
is the maximum recommended by the EPA. Water with a TDS level above 1,000 ppm
is not considered safe to drink, and levels above 2,000 ppm may
require a filtration system.

### INA219 Voltage and Current sensors (up to four on secondary i2c bus)

Load and your sensor need to share common ground.

NMEA XDR Sentences:

````
$BBXDR,U,1.036,V,VOLT_INA219_2*28
$BBXDR,I,0.000,A,AMPS_INA219_2*29
$BBXDR,W,0.000,W,WATT_INA219_2*38

###  SGP30 Air Quality and TVOC sensor connected to M5Stack AtomS3-Lite via i2c

Generates NMEA-0183 XDR sentences (USB Serial) like this:

````
$BBXDR,X,5,,TVOC*2D
$BBXDR,X,415,,eCO2*7D
$BBXDR,X,13507,,rawH2*38
$BBXDR,X,18875,,rawEthanol*14
````

Here are some TVOC levels and their associated health effects:

- 0 ppb: Good
- 220 ppb: Moderate, may cause some symptoms
- 660 ppb: Unhealthy if sensitive, more likely to cause symptoms
- 2200 ppb: Unhealthy
- 3300 ppb: Very unhealthy
- 4400 ppb: Hazardous
